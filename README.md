üìä Customer Satisfaction Tracker Dashboard
A dynamic and insightful dashboard designed to monitor and analyze key metrics related to customer service performance and satisfaction across the organization. This tracker provides a comprehensive view of call volume, customer feedback, and efficiency to help teams identify trends, pinpoint areas for improvement, and ensure service level agreement (SLA) compliance.

üéØ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard presents critical metrics at a glance for a quick health check of customer service operations:

Total Calls: 512K (The overall volume of customer interactions.)

Avg CSAT Score: 2.07 (The average Customer Satisfaction Score, indicating customer perception.)

Avg Call Duration: 25.02 seconds (Measures efficiency of handling calls.)

Sum of Call Duration: 824K (Total time spent on calls.)

‚ú® Core Features & Visualizations
This dashboard uses compelling visualizations to drill down into the data:

üó∫Ô∏è Geographical Analysis
Calls by State: A map visualization showing the geographic distribution of calls, primarily focused on North America. This helps in understanding regional service load and potential resource allocation needs.

üìà Trend and Reason Analysis
Trend of Customer Service Calls: A line chart depicting call volume over time (e.g., across October), allowing for the easy identification of peak periods or anomalies in call traffic.

Top Reasons for Calling: A bar chart highlighting the most frequent reasons customers contact support, such as Billing Questions, Payments, and Service Outage. This is crucial for proactive problem-solving and self-service development.

üìû Channel and Service Quality
Call Distribution by Channel: A doughnut chart showing the percentage breakdown of customer interactions across various channels (e.g., Email, Web, and two others).

Sum of CSAT Score by Response Time: A line graph demonstrating the relationship between response time categories (Within SLA, Below SLA, Above SLA) and the resulting CSAT score. A key insight here is that a CSAT score of ‚àí42338 is recorded for calls Within SLA, suggesting a deep-dive analysis is needed into why CSAT remains low even when response times are good.
